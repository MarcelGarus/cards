beta_box_title: <<<TODO>>> Danke für's Beta-Testen!
beta_box_body: "<<<TODO>>> Wie du siehst, funktioniert die grundlegende Spielmechanik
  bereits, allerdings mangelt es noch sehr an Inhalten, bislang gibt es nämlich
  nur 100 Karten.\nDeshalb wäre es nett, wenn du neue Karten erstellst (dazu
  unten auf's Menü gehen) und veröffentlichst. Als Gegenleistung kannst du
  deinen Namen auch auf den veröffentlichten Karten verewigen lassen.\nOh, und
  falls du Bugs findest, Ideen für neue Kartendecks oder für einen besseren
  App-Namen als \"Cards\" hast oder wenn du einfach Feedback geben willst,
  schreib mir ruhig."

  following process: The card\'s "input" (content, followup and author) as well
  as your email address will be uploaded to and permanently stored on Google\'s
  servers. By publishing the card, you automatically transfer the input\'s
  copyright to this app\'s creator Marcel Garus, who will review it manually
  and - to his liking - add it to the database of cards. If he has any
  questions, he may mail you for clarification. You confirm that the input
  adheres to the guidelines stated above. After publishing the card, you will
  not be able to edit the card any more."
